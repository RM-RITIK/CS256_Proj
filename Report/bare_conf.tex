\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}

\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{amsmath,amsthm, amsfonts, amssymb, amsxtra, amsopn}
\usepackage{booktabs} 
% Some Computer Society conferences also require the compsoc mode option,
% but others use the standard conference format.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Background}

\section{Methodology}
In this section, we begin by presenting the dataset employed in our experiments, followed by an overview of our project's experimental design.

\subsection{Dataset and Preprocessing}
Our dataset is publicly available at~\cite{dataset}. It consists of over one million Reddit self-posts among 39 genres. Due to constraints on the computation power, we took 3000 samples from each genre to reduce the training time, and employed the following preprocessing techniques:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Text in the title, selftext, and genre was converted to lowercase.
    \item Commas, periods, and text within and including angle brackets were removed from the title and selftext.
    \item Question marks and exclamation points were wrapped in white space.
    \item The title and selftext were concatenated to obtain the feature vectors and the corresponding genre was regarded as the target label.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=90mm, height = 30mm]{Images/DataPreprocessing.png}
\caption{Flow of Data}\label{fig:dataPreprocessing}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Word Embeddings}
We used three popular techniques to generate word embeddings of concatenated strings obtained in the previous step:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{TF-IDF Vectorizer}: TF-IDF Vectorizer~\cite{tfidf} assigns each word in the document a weight based on Term Frequency (TF) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF). Term Frequency measures how often a term appears in a document. The more often a term appears in a document, the higher its weight. Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) measures how important a term is within the entire corpus. Terms that appear frequently across many documents are given lower weights.
    \item \textbf{Word2Vec}: Word2Vec~\cite{word2vec} transforms words into dense vectors within a high-dimensional space. These vectors encode the semantic meaning of words, enabling machines to comprehend relationships between them. When training Word2Vec on our own corpus, we set the \textit{vector\_size} to 300 and \textit{window} to 5. The first parameter specifies the dimensionality of the word vectors and the second parameter determines the context window size. 
    \item \textbf{BERT}: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)~\cite{devlin2019bert} is a natural language processing model developed by Google. It uses self-attention mechanisms to capture relationships between words in a sentence. Unlike traditional word embedding techniques like Word2Vec, BERT considers the context of each word in a sentence bidirectionally.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Logistic Regression}
We trained a logistic regression model~\cite{Komarek-2004-8925} with all three embeddings generated in the previous step. Since, Word2Vec and BERT embeddings are generated for a word, we took an average of all the word embeddings for each sample to get a single vector representation. As a result, we obtained a feature vector of length 300 corresponding to each data sample. For hyper-parameter tuning, we considered the following hyper-parameters:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\textit{C}}: It is the inverse of regularization strength. Smaller values specify stronger regularization. Regularization helps prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. We test our logistic regression model with~$C: {0.01, 0.1, 1}$.
    \item \textbf{\textit{solver}}: It is the algorithm to use in the optimization problem. Without going into much detail, we tested our logistic regression model with the following values of $solver: {'lbfgs', 'sag', 'saga'}$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Random Forest}
Random Forest was originally proposed in~\cite{randomforestorig}. 
It comprises collections of decision trees. A decision tree is a basic supervised learning technique used for classification or prediction based on a tree-like structure. It consists of a root node, branches, internal nodes, and leaf nodes, and can be seen as a series of \texttt{if}-\texttt{else} statements. We trained a random forest model with all three embeddings, using the same feature vectors used for the logistic regression. The hyperparameter considered for our random forest model is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\textit{max\_depth}}: It represents the maximum depth of a decision tree. We tested this hyperparameter with the following values: $max\_depth: {5, 7, 10}$
    \item \textbf{\textit{n\_estimators}}: It represents the number of decision trees in the random forest. We tested this hyperparameter with the following values: $n\_estimator: {150, 200, 400}$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)}
LSTM~\cite{lstm}, a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, addresses the vanishing gradient problem that impedes traditional RNNs from effectively learning long sequences. LSTMs are specifically designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data by maintaining a memory state over time.

An LSTM comprises three gates to regulate the flow of information: the input gate, the forget gate, and the output gate. The input gate regulates the flow of new information into the memory cell, the forget gate determines which information should be discarded from the cell, and the output gate controle the exposure of the internal state. 

Each of our LSTM model comprises of 64 memory units, and also consists of a Dropout Layer and a Dense Layer with softmax activation. In the Dropout Layer, 10\% of the input units will be randomly set to 0 during each training epoch.

\subsection{LSTM-CNN}
The LSTM-CNN model is a combination of LSTM and Convolutional Neural Network~\cite{cnn}. The training procedure of our LSTM model can be described as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Generating Embeddings (or Embeddings Layer)}: Unlike the three baseline models that we discussed above, we don't take an average of all the word embeddings in a data sample. We first calculate the median number of words present in each sample, which comes out to be~$69$. If the number of words in a data sample is less than the median length, we pad the data sample, and generate word embeddings corresponding to each word in a data sample. For example, in case of BERT, corresponding to each data sample, we get a feature vector of dimensions~$(69, 768)$.
    \item \textbf{Convolutional Layer}: The feature vectors generated in the previous step are passed to the convolutional layer with ReLU activation function and 128 filters.
    \item \textbf{\textit{Max pooling Layer}}: The output from the convolutional layer is passed to the max pooling layer with the pool size of 2.
    \item \textbf{Spatial Dropout}: The next layer in our proposed model is a spatial dropout layer. Spatial dropout is a regularization technique employed to aid our model in generalization and to prevent overfitting. We apply a dropout rate of 0.2.
    \item \textbf{LSTM}: The number of LSTM units are set to the embedding dimension. For example, the number of LSTM units in the LSTM layer of BERT-LSTM-CNN is 768. Both dropout and recurrent dropout rates are set to 0.2
    \item \textbf{Dense}: This layer is fully connected, and it utilizes a softmax activation function to output the probability distribution across all classes.
\end{itemize}
\section{Results}
In this section, we present the results obtained from the techniques discussed in the previous section.
